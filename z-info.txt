These are the list of relevant files used to process and manipulate A-DTS data for Mitchell Brown's Thesis

file: read_files.R
purpose: reads in the raw data from .xml form and outputs formatted data.table

file: get_thermal_conductivity.R
purpose: Functions For Getting Thermal Conductivity From Formatted Data

1. read_snapshots
- reads in .rds file of preocessed raw data and outputs a data.table of thermal conductivity

2. read_snapshots_csv
- same as first function but outputs csv instead of a data.table

3. process_and_bind
- takes many inputs and outputs thermal conductivity of all in a single structured data.table

file: process_heating.R
purpose: Function for performing many rudimentry processing steps

- performs many steps common for processing A-DTS data
- provides the option to start heating earlier than the actual start of heating
	- this allows the visualization of termperature plots that show the onset of heating
